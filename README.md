## Synopsis

This is a Javascript-based Web-App used to roll out random roles and champs for a League of Legends game

## Motivation

Me and my friend play a lot of normal games and we constantly do not know what to play, where to go and who will fill which lane. Because of that we invented the Wheel of Fortune, which started as a Excel Sheet and became a JS-Tool after all.

## Data

All Data is stored using the browser-own LocalStorage and because of that all saved data will only be present in a specific browser and only if you do not delete the complex databases of your browser.
